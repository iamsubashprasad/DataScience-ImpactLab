# DataScience-ImpactLab
DataScience-ImpactLab is a collection of real world data science projects focused on transforming raw data into actionable business insights.


# Control and Loop
## For loop :
s= "Subash"
for i in s
  print(i)
Here, i is local variable and s will provide the each character each iteration

## Converting the each character to upper case
for i in s
  print(i.upper())

  ## List : List is something which store any type of data . 
  if you want to iterate the list value one by one , we use for loop
  List = [1.2,3,4,56]
  for i in List
     print(i)

  # Range : Range generate the data before upperbound
  Upperbounr will be silent 
  e.g : range(1,40) --> 40 will be silent 
  
  2. range(1,40,3) --> generate till 39 but jump every 3
    for i in range(0,7)
       print (i)

  3. output : subash --> sbs
     s  = "Subash Prasad"
     len = len(s)
     for i in range(len)
       print(i)

  4. for i in range(0,len,2)
       print(i)

  5. output : Reverse the name one by one - hsabus
     range(len{s)-1
     for i in range(9,0,-1)
       print(i)

   6. Pattern Printing
      *
      * *
      *  *  *
      * * *

      for i in range(1,n+1)
       print("*" *i)

      ## Function in Python
      Why we need functions : To increase the reusability
      syntax :
      def test():
        pass  -- nothing will return

      def test1():
         print("My name is sudhansu")
     # Note : in the function you should not use print becuase print will return nonetype , so use return "my name is subash"
       You can return multiple things from the functions
